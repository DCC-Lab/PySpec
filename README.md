PySpec

This is supposed to be the software used to replace the confusing software given by PrincetonInstrument.
This would a tool used specifically for spectrometers with CCD cameras, giving a few simple parameters and functions.

This tool is on hold because the communication with the PIXIS camera without going through lightField and getting 
a Princeton license doesn't seem possible for now.
